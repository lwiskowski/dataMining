Implementation of a Clustering Algorithm using K-means and bisecting K-means
Files:

Attributes.java: object that contains attributes, used for input processing

Cluster.java class for a cluster. contains an arraylist of points that belong to a cluster

Clustering.java, file with k-means, bisecting k-means as well as other stats methods

MinPair.java simple pair class

Point.java, class with all the fileds of a points. has an arraylist of fields that represnet double values.

enter command lines args in form, attributes.txt file.txt k normalize(optional)
example:
food-attr.txt food.txt 4 normalize

to run, compile Clustering.java using javac and use command line args.
