Implementation of a Classification Algorithm using Sequential Covering

Files:

Person.java

Person class, uses a hashMap to map attributes to records for each person.

Attributes.java, contains an arrayList of an array of the attribute values.

ConjunctPair: maps a conjunct to its laplace value.

Conjuncts: concatenates strings to forma a conjunct

laplaceval: Pair of rules to its laplace value

Pair.java: string to attribute value.

Rules.java: makes the rules.

SequentialCovering.java, file to run the program, has methods to find
laplace as well as the method to learn the rules.



compile: compile SequentialCovering.java using javac. Place all relevant text files
in the same directory.

running: give text file names as command line arguments. Allow a few second for the program to run
